<h2 class="feb9th">FEBRUARY 9th</h2>
<p class="feb9thd">Today we are again back to this date "FEB 9th",never knew this date is going to be so special for me,
 One year back on this date I expressed you what I feel and I know the way of telling it wasn't proper some faltu shit "r(1+cosx)" i told and I was stupid to
propose you in that foolish way and tu meri bht leg pull karti hai uske liye abhi tak meriii poojhuuu , this date is way too
important cause I got you on this date , started a beautiful journey with you my babyyyyy.If we've had so many smiles and frowns, twists and turns, and ups and downs in the very first year, imagine what the rest of our life has in store for us. Here's to a lifetime of crazy memories together.
The very first year has made me realize that I've got the best girl there is in this world. I'm so glad and blessed to have you.
A year has flown by, and I waited for this day so badly.
You are the hottest, cutest, and sweetest girl i have ever met. You rock my world!
Firsts of every kind are always great,But the first year of relationship with you has topped all the other firsts in my life.
Time just flies! Thanks for being the perfect partner.The way you make me smile no one ever can make me smile like that,i am the happiest with you every moment is magic being with you ,basss mrko tu chahiye har time every second i just wanna be with you.
Spending one year with you in pure bliss equals a thousand years of experiencing all the other pleasures of life. Haa you will be shocked that itna accha english how can i write yes this last line i copied it but bilkul perfect suit hota hai meri jaan pe yeh.
Let's go wild celebrating our first anniversary the way we spent our first night together. Here's wishing us both a rocking first marriage anniversary.
In the first year, you've shown me all the good things that I've been missing all my life.
Sometimes we have fought like hell , sometimes I really thought that I lost you but I was wrong all the time cause we are strong we have always stood strong sorted all the problems and achieved this milestone cause its always "NOT YOU VS ME ITS ALWAYS WE VS THE PROBLEM" and i promise we will ALWAYS
sit together and solve and sort everything.I know i have made you upset a lot of times in last one year but trust me poojhuuu meriii jaanuuuu babyyy its never intentional I am not perfect i grew a lot in past one year just because of you meriii cheenuuu.I have loved you and you have been in my every second thought from last one year
and now it is going to be forever meriii pyaarii jaaan , tujhe smile karte hue dekhna is the best sight I can have when you are happy i am the happiest , trko kuch bhi hota hai meri halat kharab ho jati hai poojhuu chahe frr woh "periods pain ho,fever,headache..."anything i just loose my mind and agar tu upset hoti hai the only thing
which i think about is you jaanuu ki how I can make you smile that precious smile how can i get back.
